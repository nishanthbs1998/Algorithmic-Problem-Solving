1. Look up table:
   a. Time and space complexity is O(n^2)
   b. Query time is constant, i.e O(1)
   c. This can be used for both static and dynamic arrays.
   
2. Square root decomposition:
   a. Space complexity is O(sqrt(n))
   b. Time complexity for processing is O(n)
   c. Query time is O(sqrt(n))
   d. When there is a need to cover the entire block, this method is apt.
   e. This can be used for both static and dynamic arrays.
   
3. Segment tree:
   a. Time complexity is O(logn)
   b. Processing time is O(n)
   c. It is a binary tree
   d. This can be used only for static array.
