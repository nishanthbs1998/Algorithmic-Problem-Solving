Pascal's Triangle:
Input for Pascal's triangle are binomial coefficients.

Binomial coefficients can be calculated by three methods, namely:
1. Recursion:
    a. This method can be implemented for smaller range of inputs.
    b. This method is not suitable for larger range of inputs due to a relatively more space and time consumption.

2. Dynamic Programming approach(2-D array):
    a. Unlike the recursive method, the values are computed once and stored in a 2D array.
    b. Space and time complexity is O(n*k).
  
3. Dynamic Programming approach(1-D array):
   a. This is an optimised version of DP approach. It overites the existing array and gets the new values by adding 
      to the previous value.
   b. Time complexity remains same as that of the previous method, i.e O(n*k).
   c. Out of the three methods, this method consumes least space.
